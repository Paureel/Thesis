| Neural scene representation and rendering                                                                                | Generative network, GQN                | The paper describes a so called Generative Query Network, which much like infants and animals, it learns by trying to make sense of its observations of the world around it. In doing so, the GQN learns about plausible scenes and their geometrical properties, without any human labelling of the contents of scenes.                                                                                                                                                | http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6394/1204?ijkey=kpkRRXA1ckHD6&keytype=ref&siteid=sci |
| Generative adversarial networks uncover epidermal regulators and predict single cell perturbations                       | WGAN                                   | A WGAN trained on scRNA data. It is able to generate realistic single cells in silico. The implementation on their Github is outdated. There are 3000 scRNA tidy data included in this paper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/08/262501                                        |
| Predicting drug response of tumors from integrated genomic profiles by deep neural networks                              | Dense neural network with merge layers | A neural network which can predict IC50 values from bulk cancer cells from  their RNA and mutation data. Code not inculded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                |
| Realistic in silico generation and augmentation of single cell RNA-seq data using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks | WGAN, cscGAN                           | cscGANs learn non-linear gene-gene dependencies from complex, multi cell type samples and use this information to generate realistic cells of defined types. Augmenting sparse cell populations with cscGAN generated cells improves downstream analyses such as the detection of marker genes, the robustness and reliability of classifiers, the assessment of novel analysis algorithms, and might reduce the number of animal experiments and costs in consequence. | https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/13/390153                                        |
| DeepSynergy: predicting anti-cancer drug synergy with Deep Learning                                                      | Dense neural network                   | A neural networks which aims to predict the synergy score of a drug combination on a given cancer cell line. The paper includes a lot of data and comparision methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/9/1538/4747884                              |
